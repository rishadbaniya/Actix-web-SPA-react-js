# React-js SPA and ACTIX-WEB example

Imagine, you wanna use this blazingly fast framework(actix web) to serve your React SPA(Single Paged Applications) over the internet. 

How it works?

Well.....all you need to do is serve the user 'index.html; for whatever route they wanna visit.

This is what i have showed in this example, the folder 'static_content' will have a react app and if you put 
the react router dom link over your URL section then also it will fetch you the index.html file....

Hope it helps.üòÅ(sorry for poor english)
